# ========== CAMERA

# rtigo9 and rtigo10 allow overriding the camera and tonemapper values inside the scene description file.

# Lens shader callable program.
# 0 = pinhole
# 1 = full format fisheye
# 2 = spherical projection

lensShader 0

# Camera center of interest.
# Absolute x, y, z coordinates in scene units (meters)

center 0 1.5 0

# Camera orientation relative to center of interest and projection
# phi   [0.0f, 1.0f] # 0.75 is positive z-axis
# theta [0.0f, 1.0f] # 0 is southpole, 0.5 is equator, 1.0 is north pole
# yfov in degrees [1, 179]
# distance from center of interest [0.0f, inf] in meters

# LIGHT MATERIALS

# Diffuse light material with constant intensity.
# Note that rtigo12 defines mesh and rect light emission in radiant exitance (like in the MDL_renderer example),
# not radiant intensity like the earlier renderers.
# The conversion to radiance has a factor of 1/PI for a diffuse EDF.
# Means a light with radiant exitance == PI will result in a radiance of 1.0f in the renderer.

# ========== ENVIRONMENT LIGHTS

# IMPORTANT: The one environment light inside the scene must always be defined as first light!
# Environment lights are hardcoded to light definition index 0 inside the renderer.
# Not defining an environment light will result in a black environment.
# Only enable one of these two examples!

# Constant color environment light, uniformly sampled:
push

# Spherical HDR environment light, importance sampled:

# The transformations are taken from the current state, means the spherical environment texture can be rotated arbitrarily here.
